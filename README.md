# MetaProject Zeus

This application provides REST API interface for MetaProject Zeus.

MetaProject Zeus is project implemented as part of a master thesis for FI MUNI. It is a system used for managing projects related to HPC, their workflows and entities related to projects. Part of this system is integration with Perun and OIDC.

## Run Locally

First, clone project and navigate to the project directory.

Then copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill relevant variables (more in section about environment variables)

If you are using UNIX-based system or you are using WSL (and have access to bash), you can run following helper script:

```bash
.build/prepare-dev.sh
```

This script should automatically install `node_modules` in all projects.

(If you don't have UNIX based system or something fails, you need to run `npm install` in this directories manually: `api`, `cli`, `shared/database`).

If you are running application for the first time, you should seed database with required values (such as roles, basic resources and attributes)

```
docker compose run --rm nest-js-cli sh -c "npm run execute seed"
```

Then, start server

```bash
  docker compose up
```

(If you want to have access to CLI console, start project with `docker compose up --profile cli`)

## Environment Variables

If you want to test this project, you need to copy variables from `.env.example` to `.env` and fill some variables with your values.

Most values are fine for local testing and don't have to be changed. Values like Postgres and Redis configuration are pretty self-explanatory, are working correctly in local development and should be changed to production values on production environment.

There are some environment variables, which are confidential and can't be part of public repository. If you want to use these functionalities locally, they will be provided by some other channel.

```
IDENTITY_ISSUER=https://login.e-infra.cz/oidc
IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID=my-client-id
IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET=my-client-secret
IDENTITY_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3001/auth/callback
```
Used for OIDC authentication. Need to use correct e-infra OIDC server. Callback variable depends on environment, should always end with `/auth/callback`.

```
API_PUBLICATION_MAIL_TO=test@mail.com
```
Contact mail where some logs from Crossreg API will be sent. Not needed for proper functionality but Crossreg devs can contact this email if application behaves irresponsibly.

```
PERUN_URL=https://perun-dev.cesnet.cz/
PERUN_USER=user
PERUN_PASSWORD=password
```
Used for group synchronization. Requires some configuration in Perun to work properly so proper VO needs to be used.


## Deployment

When deploying this project only production docker image is provided for API application. If you want to run CLI commands on production later, you can create similar Dockerfile.

When deploying, application needs TimescaleDB (PostgreSQL 17 compatible build, we default to `timescale/timescaledb:2.22.1-pg17`) and Redis 7.4 to function properly (it is possible to use other versions, if you test it first). You can deploy these services separately or in containers depending on the environment. You can also use Nginx, but it is not required.

To create production image run

```bash
  docker build -t nest-js-prod -f api/docker/nest-js-prod/Dockerfile .
```

You can use this image via `docker run nest-js-prod` and provide correct enviornment variables.
